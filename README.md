# JS vanilla, first in functionnal way, then the same in declarative way

Write little app in the old way, in JS vanilla, in functional programming first, then in declarative programming.

Unlike React, this program rerenders the entire DOM.

- Branch `functional` for the functionnal programming way
- Branch `declarative` for the declarative programming way
